# 🚀 Gen AI enabled Integrated Platform Environment - Pragnya

**Prajña** (Sanskrit: **प्रज्ञा**) is the highest and purest form of wisdom, intelligence and understanding. 
Prajñā is the state of wisdom which is higher than the knowledge obtained by reasoning and inference.
(Wikipedia)

**Prajña**, the **Integrated Platform Environment** is a one-stop shop for all relevant services, applications, tools, interfaces
knowledge banks, etc. This is required by Service Desk Engineers to be effectively be notified, triage and resolve incidents.
The Wisdom or Prajña (प्रज्ञा) comes from **integrating GenAI** into the platform thereby
vastly increasing the amount of information and past knowledge available to the engineer to resolve incidents
in the most efficient way thereby reducing the **MTTR** 
Most importantly the usage of LLMs and agentic capabilities, will free up a large amount of Service Desk Engineers to take up challenging tasks and building the next generation of applications.
